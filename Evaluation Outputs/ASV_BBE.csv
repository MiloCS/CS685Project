495,"For I delivered unto you first of all that which also I received: that Christ died for our sins according to the scriptures; 
",I've been telling you the first thing I got: That Jesus died for our sins in the scriptures.,"For I gave to you first of all what was handed down to me, how Christ underwent death for our sins, as it says in the Writings;

"
500,"and last of all, as to the child untimely born, he appeared to me also. 
",he looked at me with a look that seemed to be the last of all.,"And last of all, as by one whose birth was out of the right time, he was seen by me.
"
501,"For I am the least of the apostles, that am not meet to be called an apostle, because I persecuted the church of God. 
","I'm not an apostle, but I'm the least of the apostles, so I'm not called an apostle.","For I am the least of the Apostles, having no right to be named an Apostle, because of my cruel attacks on the church of God.

",how do you think some of you think there's no resurrection of the dead?,"Now if the good news says that Christ came back from the dead, how do some of you say that there is no coming back from the dead?
"
505,"But if there is no resurrection of the dead, neither hath Christ been raised: 
","if the dead don't rise, neither will the dead.","But if there is no coming back from the dead, then Christ has not come back from the dead:

519,"For, He put all things in subjection under his feet. But when he saith, All things are put in subjection, it is evident that he is excepted who did subject all things unto him. 
","he said, All things are subject to him, but when he says, All things are subject to him, it is clear that he is excluded from the subject.","For, as it says, He has put all things under his feet. But when he says, All things are put under him, it is clear that it is not said about him who put all things under him.
"
520,"And when all things have been subjected unto him, then shall the Son also himself be subjected to him that did subject all things unto him, that God may be all in all.

"
802,"But food will not commend us to God: neither, if we eat not, are we the worse; nor, if we eat, are we the better. 
","if we don't eat, we won't be better, or worse.","But God's approval of us is not based on the food we take: if we do not take it we are no worse for it; and if we take it we are no better.

",be careful not to make any of your freedom a stumbling block to the weak.,"But take care that this power of yours does not give cause for trouble to the feeble.

804,"For if a man see thee who hast knowledge sitting at meat in an idol's temple, will not his conscience, if he is weak, be emboldened to eat things sacrificed to idols? 
","if a man sees you sitting in a meat-eating temple, he won't be able to eat anything sacrificed to idols, if he's weak?","For if a man sees you, who have knowledge, taking food as a guest in the house of an image, will it not give him, if he is feeble, the idea that he may take food offered to images?
"
805,"For through thy knowledge he that is weak perisheth, the brother for whose sake Christ died. 
","he who is weak is perishing, the brother who died for his sake.","And so, through your knowledge, you are the cause of destruction to your brother, for whom Christ underwent death.
"
806,"And thus, sinning against the brethren, and wounding their conscience when it is weak, ye sin against Christ. 
","so, when you sin against the brothers, you sin against God's will.","And in this way, doing evil to the brothers, and causing trouble to those whose faith is feeble, you are sinning against Christ.
"
807,"Wherefore, if meat causeth my brother to stumble, I will eat no flesh for evermore, that I cause not my brother to stumble.","if meat causes my brother to fall, I'm not gonna eat meat, so I don't cause my brother to fall.","For this reason, if food is a cause of trouble to my brother, I will give up taking meat for ever, so that I may not be a cause of trouble to my brother.
